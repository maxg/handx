# Exercise 1

Exercises are in a `&lt;div class="exercises">`.

Use `#` for exercise titles.

Highlight questions using `##`:

## What is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?

[x] Checkboxes
[x] *with* **styles**
[ ] `and code`

( ) Radio buttons
(x) *with* **styles**
( ) `and code`

Use Markdown blockquote (`>`) for explanations.

> The answer is: 42.

---

# Exercise 2

Separate multiple exercises with a Markdown horizontal rule (`---`).

[x] OK

Dropdowns and text fields have normal and `code` versions:

[[ Drop, (down) ]]

[[` code, (correct()), incorrect), (incorrect, incorrect() `]]

= text field

= `code text field`

> Explanation with `inline_code` and a code block:
>
> ```java
> public void blockOfCode() { }
> ```

---

# Exercise 3

Text fields can also be checked against a regular expression:

= /regular expression|regexp?/ regex

= `/a +b +c/ a b c`

---

# Exercise 4 {.exercise-expand .exercise-no-iterate}

This exercise starts expanded, and its explanation is always revealed after the first attempt.

[x] Don't check me
